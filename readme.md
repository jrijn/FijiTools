## FlexoscopeFormatter

This script is used for routine processing of two-channel stacks from the flexoscope in the Sellin lab. The first (DIC) channel is filtered to remove non-mobile background using a medianfilter. The second (fluorescent bacteria) channel is filtered to remove all swimming bacteria using a gliding median projection of every 3 frames.
